# citibike-challenge

Trips recorded as per the year 2020 which shows that people used to use citibike more in summer than in winter
User type where subscribers use more during the start of summer as well as customers but not to the level of subscribers this shows many people commute on citibike on daily basis
When analysed in the timespan of 24hrs during weekdays of the summer months it is seen that it reaches peak during weekends and in weekdays a little less but apprx. in between 8am-8pm.
When analysed in the timespan of 24hrs during weekdays of the winter months it is seen that it reaches peak during weekends and in weekdays the demand is high during 06:00am -08:00am and 04:00 pm-07:00 pm
Top 10 stations to start journey where we can see that Grove St Path And Newport pkwy , Liberty light Rail are the top 3 which might give us a vague idea that there are a lot of people who come to visit the city are tourists who prefer citibike
Top 10 stations to end journey is almost the same places 
Bottom 10 stations to  start journey shows that the avg. users might be locals of that place rather than tourists 
Bottom 10  stations shows not much people prefer these stations and it might be close place for people to walk and reach, which much of the locals prefer doing
Dashboard showing travel by gender and the avg age group who prefer citibike which shows males use citibike more than females and others and one more imp thing is that the age group of male is in between 48 -52 whereas females is in between 36-42 and others 32-38.
Starting station maps shows the most preferred stations are in New Jersey(07302) with a lot of subscribers and customers  equally divided
End station maps shows that there are more customers than subscribers where more people are travelling to NYC and NJ which also depicts that customers use to travel than annual subscribers


From the given data,
We observe that citibike is widely used by the people be it any type of users in which annual subscribers prefer to tavel more than path trains and subways in a busy city like NYC which also gives us a vague idea that it is such a big city where citibike is in much demand besides other ways of transport where the it is always in much demand during busy hours.
Another imp. aspect shows that there are a lot of subscribers than customers where we see that locals also prefer using citibike rather than tourists .
